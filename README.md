# RankedPlaylistMaker
A program that once the user enters an artist, the artist's songs are web-scraped from www.songsfacts.com with artist songs. 
These songs are scraped into a an artist song file. They are read into an algorithm to be ranked by the user. 
The user is prompted to choose between 2 different songs by the chosen artist. 
The user also has the option to select "I don't know" or "I like them the same".
The user interface includes the percent sorted as the user selects between songs.
This process continues until the user has a ranked playlist of 10 songs by the artist.
